            The Brady Scholars is a three-year program at Northwestern aiming to connect the study of ethics to community service and civic engagement. The program includes a series of classes on moral and political philosophy, a study-abroad component where students are encouraged to consider ethics in a global and comparative context, and a senior capstone project. The Brady Scholars 16s cohort (graduating June 2026) has chosen to address food insecurity in Evanstonâ€™s 5th Ward for their senior capstone project.
