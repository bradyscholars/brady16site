              This project aims to increase C&W's long-term capacity to fight food insecurity in a more sustainable manner, by providing Evanston residents with year-round access to grocery-store quality goods, with an emphasis on produce and healthy protein options.  We hope to maximize C&W's organizational capacity to store and distribute grocery goods by renovating and expanding the market's refrigeration, ventilation, and storage space.

Currently, the products offered by C&W's convenience store are limited to shelf items, processed foods, and a very small supply of produce and hygiene products. Additionally, their distribution efforts are centered around a small basement food pantry and bi-weekly food drive.
